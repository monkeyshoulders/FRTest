# RSS Feed Reader Project FEND
---

This project was created as a part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program. I was to take the resource materials that were provided and finish writing a test suite in Jasmine. I had to research the JavaScript and HTML files to gain a understanding of how the application worked and then reverse engineer the test suite to finish writing the test that would make the code pass.

## How to Evaluate Project

This page can be evaluated for all layouts by running it via your machine. The first step is to download or clone this repository to your local machine. Open the index.html file and inspect the bottom of the page where the Jasmine console is located. Then enter the feedreader.js file spec folder to inspect the test that were written.

## Resources used

I watched the video content provided in the Nanodegree program to complete this project as well as reading the Jasmine documentation. It was pretty straightforward so no other material was needed.
